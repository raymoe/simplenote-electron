Then the code starts with all zero bits\n   for the first code of the shortest length, and the codes are integer\n   increments for the same length, and zeros are appended as the length\n   increases.  For the deflate format, these bits are stored backwards\n   from their more natural integer increment ordering, and so when the\n   decoding tables are built in the large loop below, the integer codes\n   are incremented backwards.\n\n   This routine assumes, but does not check, that all of the entries in\n   lens[] are in the range 0..MAXBITS.  The caller must assure this.\n   1..MAXBITS is interpreted as that code length.  zero means that that\n   symbol does not occur in this code.\n\n   The codes are sorted by computing a count of codes for each length,\n   creating from that a table of starting indices for each length in the\n   sorted table, and then entering the symbols in order in the sorted\n   table.

Skipped or `false` means Z_NO_FLUSH, `true` means Z_FINISH.\n *\n * Sends input data to inflate pipe, generating [[Inflate#onData]] calls with\n * new output chunks. Returns `true` on success. The last data block must have\n * mode Z_FINISH (or `true`). That will flush internal pending buffers and call\n * [[Inflate#onEnd]]. For interim explicit flushes (without ending the stream) you\n * can use mode Z_SYNC_FLUSH, keeping the decompression context.\n *\n * On fail call [[Inflate#onEnd]] with error code and return false.\n *\n * We strongly recommend to use `Uint8Array` on input for best speed (output\n * format is detected automatically). Also, don't skip last param and always\n * use the same type in your code (boolean or number).
